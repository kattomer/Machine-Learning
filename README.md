# Machine Learning Projects

## Overview
This repository contains a series of machine learning assignments implemented in Jupyter Notebooks. Each assignment focuses on different machine learning paradigms and algorithms, providing practical insights and solutions.

## Projects

### Assignment 1: Unsupervised Learning
This notebook explores various unsupervised learning techniques with an emphasis on clustering and dimensionality reduction.  

**Techniques:** Includes methods such as k-means clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

### Assignment 2: Linear Regression, Naive Bayes, and Decision Tree
This notebook delves into supervised learning algorithms including Linear Regression, Naive Bayes, and Decision Trees. It provides foundational understanding and practical application examples.  

**Techniques:** Demonstrates the application of these algorithms to regression and classification problems, including data preprocessing, model fitting, and evaluation using appropriate metrics.

### Assignment 3: Advanced Techniques
This assignment covers advanced machine learning techniques with a strong emphasis on data preprocessing and ensemble methods.  

**Techniques:**
- **Data Preprocessing:** In-depth handling of missing values using KNN imputation for numeric data and mode imputation for categorical data.
- **AdaBoost:** Implementation from scratch to enhance understanding of ensemble methods and their application in improving model performance.

## Prerequisites
- **Python 3**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Libraries:** Includes NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib (for data visualization), and possibly others depending on the specific assignments.
